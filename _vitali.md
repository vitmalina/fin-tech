Notes on FixTrader

1. The best way to organize apps are as a SPA (single page application).
- What is a SPA?
- everything else is a module
- Deep linking via hash tags or push state
- Module lazy loading, progressively loads as

2. Icons
- a great way is to create icon fonts, (though recently just plain svg files seem to become more and more popular)
- will require a build process

3. CSS pre-compilers
- less or none as browerse
- will require a build process

4. Testing & Linting
- will require a build process
- linting is a standard for web developments now
- testing via PlayWright

5. Use npm with front-end projects
- add project.json
- add server.js to server files

6. Instead of putting the code in lib/impx, lets keep it in the app and use lib for 3d party libraries
